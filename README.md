# clearingtools
Computer logs clearing function to prevent getting caught in screenshares.
This is free to use but you need to give me credit (etc. self-destruct by rackout#1111)

Installation:
Put the ClearingInstance.cs into your project and include an external way to get into the menu of it
etc:
```
this.Hide();
ClearingInstance m = new ClearingInstance();
m.Show();
```
You can make your own gui with it or copy the code idc as long as the credit is given to me.
